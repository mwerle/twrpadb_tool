# twrpadb_tool

A small utility which can can be used to check and extract data from a TWRP ADB Backup file (v3).

The concept came originally from the [arifogel/twrpabx](https://github.com/arifogel/twrpabx) project, however as it failed to parse my backup file I rewrote it more or less from scratch and this is the result.
